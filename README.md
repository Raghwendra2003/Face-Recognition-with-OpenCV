# Face Recognition with OpenCV

Welcome to the Face Recognition project using OpenCV! This project showcases how to build a face recognition system capable of detecting and recognizing faces in images and video streams.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **Face Detection:** Uses Haar cascades or DNN models for detecting faces.
- **Face Recognition:** Matches detected faces against a pre-trained dataset.
- **Real-time Processing:** Supports live face detection and recognition from video streams.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Includes a command-line interface for ease of use.

## üì¶ Installation
To get started, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raghwendra2003/face-recognition-opencv.git
   ```
   *Clone the repository to your local machine.*

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd face-recognition-opencv
   ```
   *Move into the project directory.*

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Install the necessary Python libraries specified in `requirements.txt`.*

## üöÄ Usage
Follow these instructions to use the face recognition system:

1. **Prepare your dataset:** 
   - Place images of known faces in the `dataset/` directory.
   - Ensure images are well-labeled for accurate recognition.

2. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   *Train the face recognition model with your dataset.*

3. **Run face recognition:**
   ```bash
   python recognize_faces.py
   ```
   *Detect and recognize faces in static images.*

4. **For video stream processing:** 
   ```bash
   python recognize_faces_video.py
   ```
   *Process real-time video streams for face recognition.*
